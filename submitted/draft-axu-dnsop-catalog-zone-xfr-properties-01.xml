<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t><xref target="RFC9432">DNS Catalog Zones</xref> described a method for automatic DNS zone provisioning among DNS name servers by the catalog of zones to be provisioned as one or more regular DNS zones.
Configuration associated with the member zones, such as from which primary name servers and with which <xref target="RFC8945">TSIG keys</xref> to transfer the zones, and from which IP addresses and with which TSIG keys <xref target="RFC1996">DNS notifies</xref> are allowed, were assumed to be preprovisioned at the catalog consumer.</t>

<t>This document specifies DNS Catalog Zones Properties to specify primary name servers from which to transfer the member zones, as well as properties to specify which IP addresses, using which cryptographic keys, are allowed to notify the secondary name server serving the member zones, in order to:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>remove the necessity to preprovision those at the catalog consumers,</t>
  <t>to fascilitate ad-hoc changes, and</t>
  <t>to fascilitate exceptions for individual member zones.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The new properties, specified in <xref target="new-properties"/>, <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be at the apex of the catalog zone, where they will affect all member zones, or under a member zone label, where they will affect just that member zone. Any property under a member zone label will override that same property at the apex.</t>

<section anchor="binding-additional-attributes"><name>Binding additional attributes</name>

<t>It is possible to distinguish groups of values with all the properties from <xref target="new-properties"/>, by adding an additional label before the property.
This allows binding additional attributes within the group, for example binding TSIG keys to certain IP addresses.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="cnames-and-dnames"><name>CNAMEs and DNAMEs</name>

<t>This document updates <xref target="RFC9432"/> by explicitly allowing CNAMEs <xref target="RFC1035"/> and DNAMEs <xref target="RFC6672"/> anywhere in the catalog.
The CNAME and DNAME RRs in an catalog zone <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> refer to names within the same (catalog) zone.
When a CNAME and DNAME RRs refer to owner names outside of the (catalog) zone, they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be considered invalid and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored.</t>

<t>For example, using some of the properties from <xref target="new-properties"/>:</t>

The order may be used following the default selection process in use by the catalog consumer name server software.</t>

<t>Different primaries <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be distinguished by an additional label, which will allow binding additional attributes to each server.</t>

The presence of a TLSA RRset signals support of DNS over TLS (DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"/> or DNS over QUIC (DoQ) <xref target="RFC9250"/> by the primary and the means by which the catalog consumer can successfully authenticate the primary.
TLSA RRsets <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepended by two labels (below the <spanx style="verb">property</spanx> label <em>with</em> the extra label) indicating the decimal representation of the port number (see <xref section="3" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC6698"/>) and the protocol name of the transport (see <xref section="4" sectionFormat="of" target="I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-svcb-dane-05"/>).
Catalog consumers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> transfer member zone and incremental updates over either DoT or DoQ in the presence of a TLSA RRset.</t>

<t>An authentication domain name (see <xref section="2" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8310"/>) <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be provided by a PTR RRset, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consist of a single PTR RR, at the same name as the TLSA RRset.

The property <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain a RRset of type <xref target="RFC3123">APL</xref>, which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consist of only a single APL RR.
The prefixes listed in the APL RR are processed in order:
  - An IP address is allowed to query the zone when it matches a prefix.
  - An IP address is denied to query the zone when it matches a negated prefix.</t>

<t>The absence of an <spanx style="verb">allow-query</spanx> property at both apex of the catalog as well as at a member zone, means that the default policy applies, which may be that the member zone is allowed to be queried from any IP address without TSIG key.</t>

<t>Additional attributes (such as TSIG keys) can be bound to specific APL RRs by an additional label below the property label.
The prefixes (with or without attributes) will be processed in <xref section="6" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC4034">canonical order</xref>, which means that the RRsets at the <spanx style="verb">allow-query</spanx> property label will be processed first, followed by the RRsets with the additional label in canonical order.
When a catalog consumer encounters an APL RRset containing more that a single APL RR, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be interpreted as an APL RRset containing a single APL RR denying all IP addresses, i.e.: <spanx style="verb">APL !1:0.0.0.0/0 !2:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/0</spanx>.</t>

<section anchor="tsig-key-name-2"><name>TSIG Key Name</name>

The key(s) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be defined elsewhere, such as in the configuration file of the consumer.</t>

<t>If a TXT RRset is present together with an APL RR, then first the policies in the APL are applied, and if that results in queries being allowed for the IP address, then in addition a TSIG key <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> match any of the TXT RRs in the TXT RRset.
If a TXT RRset is present without an APL RRset, then only a TSIG key <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> match in any of the TXT RRs in the TXT RRset, regardless of the querying IP address.</t>

<t>If an <spanx style="verb">allow-query</spanx> property is present <em>and</em> contains APL RRsets and/or TXT RRsets (either directly below the property label or below the additional label), <em>and</em> none of the ACLs and/or TSIG keys matched or could be found, then the consumer <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> allow queries for the member zone to which the property applies.</t>

<section anchor="groups"><name>Assigning properties to groups</name>

<t>It is possible to assign the properties from this document to catalog groups (see <xref section="4.3.2." sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9432"/>).
To this end this document introduces the <spanx style="verb">groups</spanx> property.</t>

<section anchor="groups-the-groups-property"><name>Groups (the <spanx style="verb">groups</spanx> property)</name>

<t>The list of calalog group that have properties assigned to it, is specified as a collection of member nodes represented by TXT RRs under the owner name "groups" where "groups" is a direct child domain of the catalog zone.
The names of member zones are represented on the RDATA side of a TXT record (instead of being represented as a part of owner names) so that all valid group names may be represented.
This TXT record <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be the only record in the TXT RRset with the same name.
The presence of more than one record in the RRset indicates a broken catalog zone that <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be processed (see <xref section="5.1." sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9432"/>).
For example, if a catalog zone lists two catalog groups ("foo" and "bar"), the member node RRs would appear as follows:</t>

<figure><artwork type="ascii-art"><![CDATA[
<unique-1>.groups.$CATZ  0 IN TXT    "foo"
<unique-2>.groups.$CATZ  0 IN TXT    "bar"
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>where <spanx style="verb">&lt;unique-N&gt;</spanx> is a label that tags each record in the collection and has a unique value.
When different <spanx style="verb">&lt;unique-N&gt;</spanx> labels hold the same TXT value (i.e., provide more than a single place to assign properties to the same group), the catalog zone is broken and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be processed (see <xref section="5.1." sectionFormat="of" target="RFC9432"/>).</t>

<t>Properties assigned to a catalog group, below an entry below the <spanx style="verb">groups</spanx> property extends the configuration that was already associated with that group.
If the existing configuration for the group had a configuration value, that is also targeted with property assigned for the group, then the assigned properties value <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> override the original value.
If there was no existing group yet, then an entry below the <spanx style="verb">groups</spanx> property defines the new group.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="implementation-and-operational-notes"><name>Implementation and Operational Notes</name>

<t>One of the rationales for allowing CNAMEs and DNAMEs is that a large and complex catalog may have large and complex access lists repeated a million times. But if there are only a few different access lists, they could be defined separately and then be referenced a million times, reducing both the size and processing effort of the catalog zone.</t>

<t>Alternatively, a group property may be used for this, which will or will not have additional properties assigned to it under the <spanx style="verb">groups</spanx> property (see <xref target="groups"/>).</t>

<t><strong>[NOTE to the RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication]</strong></t>

<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft <xref target="RFC7942"/>.</t>

<t>The existing BIND 9 implementation of <spanx style="verb">primaries</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">allow-transfer</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">allow-query</spanx> was a major inspiration for writing this draft.</t>

<section anchor="security-and-privacy-considerations"><name>Security and Privacy Considerations</name>

<t>The original RFC for Catalog Zones already covers a lot of security and privacy considerations, and they are all still valid, but there are also new security considerations introduced by this document.</t>

<section anchor="private-zone-exfiltration"><name>Private Zone Exfiltration</name>

<t>If the Catalog Zone producer and consumer are different organizations, the producer may be able to use a crafted Catalog Zone to exfiltrate a private zone on another server within the consumer's network by listing it in the Catalog Zone with more permissive query or transfer access lists. The producer needs to know the exact name of the private zone and an address of the primary where the consumer may fetch it from.</t>

<t>There are two ways to approach this security issue. One is to make sure that the consumer organisation does not allow zone transfers for private zones on the consuming server. Another approach is to sanitize the incoming Catalog Zone before consuming it, removing anything sensitive from it.</t>

      <t>This document describes the use of QUIC to provide transport confidentiality for DNS. The encryption provided by QUIC has similar properties to those provided by TLS, while QUIC transport eliminates the head-of-line blocking issues inherent with TCP and provides more efficient packet-loss recovery than UDP. DNS over QUIC (DoQ) has privacy properties similar to DNS over TLS (DoT) specified in RFC 7858, and latency characteristics similar to classic DNS over UDP. This specification describes the use of DoQ as a general-purpose transport for DNS and includes the use of DoQ for stub to recursive, recursive to authoritative, and zone transfer scenarios.</t>
